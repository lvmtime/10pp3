## 10 PRINT in Pyhton 2 and 3

This is a pure Python implementation of the 10 PRINT Commodere 64 program.

If you never heard of "10 PRINT" [there is a book about it](https://10print.org/) !

This version does not use any external Python libraries, but your terminal font must support Unicode, specifically characters U+2571 and U+2572

Can you see them on this line? &#9585;&#9586;

Here is an image from Ubuntu's default virtual terminal:
